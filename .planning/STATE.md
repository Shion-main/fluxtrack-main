# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-02)

**Core value:** A faculty member checks in with one action, and the resulting attendance record is trustworthy — presence physically verified, lateness captured, ghost bookings detected.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — MSSQL Environment & Data Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 8 (MSSQL Environment & Data Foundation)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-07-02 — Roadmap created (8 phases, 57/57 requirements mapped)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: notify() write path (NOTIF-00) pulled forward into Phase 2 (correctness foundations) — it is a prerequisite for JOB-02 conflict flags AND modality approval notices; only NOTIF-01/02/03 read+push stay in Phase 5.
- [Roadmap]: JOB-02's Absent rule and the scan resolver's Absent rule must share ONE extracted predicate (Phase 2) — highest-risk coupling in the milestone.
- [Roadmap]: IFO-06 floor assignments land at the start of Phase 3 — they hard-block Checker on-duty gating (CHK-01).
- [Roadmap]: Reporting aggregates (RPT-01/04) built once in Phase 6; IFO-09, DEAN-04, and HR consume them — DEAN-04 dashboard therefore sits in Phase 6, not Phase 4.
- [Roadmap]: Auth (Entra) + AWS/Tailwind deploy deferred to Phase 8 so cutover risk never blocks feature work; dev-login stub carries every earlier phase.

### Pending Todos

[From .planning/todos/pending/ — ideas captured during sessions]

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

[Issues that affect future work]

- [Phase 1]: MSSQL runtime behavior (collation case-insensitivity, datetime2/timezone round-trip) unproven — needs a dedicated spike with real round-trip tests before JOB-02 is built on top. An 8h Asia/Manila drift is possible if UTC storage is not verified.
- [Phase 8]: Tailwind v4 / Franken UI 2.1 build path (npm-plugin vs standalone-CLI) is MEDIUM confidence — needs a short build spike before committing to build-time-npm/Node-free production.
- [Phase 8]: Entra cutover can lock out all production login if DEBUG=False is flipped before SSO is proven end-to-end — keep a break-glass superuser; verify on staging.
- [General]: RDS SQL Server Express 10 GB cap + per-write AuditLog rows needs a retention/pruning job before real usage (address in Phase 8).
